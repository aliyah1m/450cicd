Tekton Pipelines Testing

1. Variable injection- Ways that parameters can be passed dynamically
    -> Runtime parameter
        -> COMPLETED
        -> ";whoami;#
    -> Github push triggered pipeline with user input

2. Accessing secret files- Ways that secrets can be stored
    -> As a kubernetes secret, injected as an environment variable into a Tekton Task
        -> COMPLETED
        -> can only access if you know the variable names beforehand
        -> can only work within the specific task its deployed in 
    -> As a file, mounted under /secrets/PASSWORD
    -> As a file in Tekton Workspace- Kubernetes secret mounted as Tekton workspace
        -> each Tekton Task runs in its own Kubernetes Pod, it does not 
           automatically share files with other tasks. Workspaces solve 
           this by providing a shared storage location that multiple tasks can access.
